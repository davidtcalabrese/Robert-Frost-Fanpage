      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Robert Lee Frost (March 26, 1874 â€“ January 29, 1963) was an American
        poet. Initially published in England, his work later became popular in the United States. Known for his realistic depictions of
        rural life and his command of American colloquial speech,[2] Frost
        frequently wrote about settings from rural life in New England in the
        early 20th century, using them to examine complex social and
        philosophical themes.
